This is the official repository for the 2025 AI2S Hackaton.

The structure is the following: 
the code for each task is in its corresponding folder under the name "Official model #Task number#". 
others code are just experiments collapsed there (but not the code for the official code).
the same occurs for the bucket folder, just experiments and a bit of data analysis.
